## üîß Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-generator.git
cd claude-generator

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install package (development mode)
pip install -e .
```

## üìù Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new project config
scaffold --create-config --config my_project.json

# Generate project plan
scaffold --config my_project.json --tier initial --output plan.txt

# Generate files based on the plan
scaffold --config my_project.json --enable-tier file_generation --tier file_generation --input plan.txt
```

## üíº AI Code Generation Success Story

Our demo project showcases the power of Claude Generator for real-world applications:

- **Complete End-to-End AI Development**: Entire application with frontend, backend, API and database generated in one run
- **Production-Ready Code Quality**: High-quality, well-structured code that works immediately out-of-the-box
- **Unbeatable Cost-Efficiency**: Full-stack application with complete source code generated for only $4.01 in AI costs
- **10x Development Speed**: What would take days or weeks of manual coding accomplished in minutes

## üì¶ Advanced Configuration

The system uses JSON configuration files with the following structure:

```json
{
  "project_name": "my_project",
  "description": "A sample project",
  "variables": {
    "concept": "Web application for task management",
    "language": "python"
  },
  "tiers": {
    "initial": {
      "enabled": true,
      "prompt_template": {
        "content": "Create a plan for $concept using $language with consideration for $system",
        "variables": {}
      },
      "use_system_info": true,
      "output_format": "text"
    },
    "file_generation": {
      "enabled": false,
      "prompt_template": {
        "content": "Generate file $file_name based on the plan: $input",
        "variables": {}
      },

## Notes from the Author

- My complete chat log with Claude is included with this project for reference.
- I originally developed this tool for personal use, but after seeing its impressive first-run demo, I decided it was worth sharing.
- I'm considering integrating additional tools such as dSpy / TextGrad to enhance its functionality further.
- Unfortunately, since the tool was built using Claude-generated code via prompt piping, it's currently limited in usefulness to those with access to the research preview.
- I'm also evaluating the possibility of transitioning to the OpenAI API, which aligns well with many model providers, or potentially Ollama, to allow easier portability and adaptation.
- Potentialy a Frontend for easy input possibly or a tester agent which will verify the code works at the end and fixes it if necessary, however pydantic may already be solving this issue as this was a 1 - shot prompt.
